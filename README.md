# Secure & Scalable Genomic Computing System in HPC Infrastructure

This repository presents two co-authored technical research documentation reports, authored by Harihara Sudhan Shanmugam (Computational Research Technician) in collaboration with Chamodi Korala Hewage (Research System Developer) at Buckinghamshire New University. The work was carried out within the Pathogen Genomics Unit and addresses real-world system design challenges in high-performance computing (HPC) environments tailored to biomedical research.

These reports document the secure architectural design and deployment of hybrid HPC infrastructures and AI-powered bioinformatics systems, developed to support sensitive genomic variant analysis. The project integrates container security, cloud-native orchestration, and model optimization techniques to deliver both high computational performance and robust data protection, ensuring compliance and scalability in research-intensive environments.

This page serves as a **summary portal** for both projects. Interested reviewers, supervisors, or evaluators may directly access the **technical research documentation reports** by clicking the PDF links below.
